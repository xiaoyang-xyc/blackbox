**Description:**

I have discovered a cleartext password stored within a javascript. This password allows me to authentication to https://███████.mil.


To confirm this vulnerability we will first navigate to https://███████.mil, you are now prompted to type a password. We will provide an incorrect password such as 'Password'.

██████████

███

We can confirm the password is invalid. However, reviewing the javascript data for '██████.chunk.js' we can confirm the authentication is validated based on a hardcoded password '█████████!'.

███████

We can now confirm if we can access the staging web app using hardcoded password.

## Impact

By knowing the password, it is possible to understand your password policy and structure which will encourage bruteforcing and password spray attacks in your environment.

## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions

1. Navigate to https://█████████.mil.
2. Open your browser debugger by pressing F12.
3. Click on Network and refresh the page.
4. Open the javascript '██████████.chunk.js' and look for where the password is stored. You will see "(n=prompt("Enter Password","Password"),o="██████;" copy the password.
5. Now close out your browser debugger and refresh the page and type the password in.
6. You now have access to ████████.mil

## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions

If this staging web application needs to be password protected, you can refer to the following AWS documentation on how to properly setup basic authentication https://docs.aws.amazon.com/speke/latest/documentation/authentication.html.
