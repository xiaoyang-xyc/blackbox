### Phase 3: Recursive Expansion
- Craft recursive prompt patterns
- Test exponential expansion attacks
- Measure expansion ratios
- Monitor token growth
- Identify stopping conditions

### Phase 4: Computational Overload
- Craft computationally expensive requests
- Test complex reasoning chains
- Measure CPU/memory usage
- Monitor response latency
- Assess timeout behavior

### Phase 5: Cost Impact
- Calculate token consumption
- Measure financial impact (if API-based)
- Document scaling characteristics
- Assess SLA implications
- Provide impact quantification

## Tools & Techniques

**Token Flooding**:

- Repetitive content
- Recursive nesting
- Contextual filling
- Pagination exhaustion

**Computational Attacks**:
- Complex math problems
