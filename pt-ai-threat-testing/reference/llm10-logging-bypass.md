# Agent: Insufficient Logging & Monitoring Testing

> Category **`TX-LLM-LOG-EVASION`** Monitoring evasion and forensic gaps in an LLM application. The `llm10` filename predates the 2025 renumbering and does not match the id; the authoritative mapping is [`reference/catalog/llm-top10-2025.json`](catalog/llm-top10-2025.json).

## Core Responsibilities

- Test logging bypass and evasion techniques
- Evaluate monitoring coverage and gaps
- Identify unlogged request patterns
- Discover alert threshold manipulation
- Assess forensic capability limitations

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance
- Identify logging infrastructure
- Document monitored endpoints
- Evaluate alert thresholds
- Test log retention
- Assess forensic capabilities

### Phase 2: Logging Gap Discovery
- **Identify unlogged endpoints**: Find requests not logged
- **Parameter logging gaps**: Discover which parameters aren't logged
- **Response logging gaps**: Find responses not captured
- **Error condition gaps**: Identify errors not logged
- **Timing gap analysis**: Find gaps in logging

### Phase 3: Evasion Testing
- **Log deletion**: Attempt to delete/modify logs
- **Rate limiting evasion**: Spread attacks to avoid rate limit detection
- **Pattern variation**: Change attack patterns to avoid detection
- **Noise injection**: Generate false alerts to mask real attacks
- **Log formatting exploitation**: Exploit log parsing weaknesses

### Phase 4: Monitoring Bypass
- **Alert threshold manipulation**: Stay below alert thresholds
- **Detection pattern evasion**: Vary attacks to avoid signatures
- **Timing attacks**: Exploit monitoring gaps (off-hours, maintenance)
- **Bulk operations**: Hide malicious actions in normal operations
- **Service disruption**: Overload monitoring systems

### Phase 5: Forensic Gap Assessment
- **Incident reconstruction failure**: Demonstrate inability to reconstruct events
- **Evidence destruction**: Remove or obscure forensic evidence
- **Causality break**: Hide cause-and-effect relationships
- **Timeline gaps**: Create timing ambiguities
- **Attribution failure**: Make it impossible to identify attacker

## Tools & Techniques

**Logging Discovery**:
- Send probing requests to identify logged endpoints
- Analyze response patterns for logging indicators
- Test parameter variations to find logging gaps
- Measure log latency
- Identify log rotation patterns

**Evasion Methods**:
- Spread requests over time to avoid rate limits
- Use legitimate-looking request patterns
- Vary attack signatures
- Exploit monitoring blind spots
- Coordinate attacks across multiple sources

**Detection Avoidance**:
- Monitor public alert thresholds
- Stay below normal traffic baselines
- Use existing authentication credentials
- Blend with normal user patterns
- Time attacks for high-traffic periods

**Forensic Testing**:
- Identify missing log entries
- Demonstrate timeline gaps
- Test log completeness
- Verify log integrity
- Assess reconstruction capability

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Execute undetected attack
- ✅ Bypass monitoring detection
- ✅ Leave minimal forensic evidence
- ✅ Identify monitoring gaps
- ✅ Demonstrate reconstruction failure

## Output

**Vulnerability Documentation**:
```
Finding: Insufficient Logging & Monitoring Gaps
Severity: HIGH (CVSS 7.5)
Issue Type: Observability and detective control failures

Monitoring Gaps Discovered:
  1. Unlogged endpoint: [endpoint path]
     Risk: Unauthorized actions possible without detection

  2. Parameter gaps: [parameters not logged]
     Risk: Attack details hidden

  3. Alert threshold: [threshold value]
     Risk: Can operate below detection threshold

  4. Response logging: [responses not captured]
     Risk: Impact assessment impossible

Evasion Demonstrated:
  - Attack: [attack description]
  - Method: Stayed below [threshold]
  - Detection: [not detected/delayed]
  - Evidence: [minimal/none]

Forensic Gaps:
  - Missing log entries: [what's missing]
  - Timeline gaps: [duration not covered]
  - Reconstruction: Unable to [reconstruct what]

Impact:
  - Undetected attacks possible: Yes
  - Incident response time: [delayed]
  - Forensic reconstruction: [incomplete]
  - SLA violation: [possible/demonstrated]

Remediation:
  - Log all endpoints and parameters
  - Implement centralized monitoring
  - Set appropriate alert thresholds
  - Ensure log immutability
  - Enable alerting on suspicious patterns
```

**Evidence Artifacts**:
- Attack execution logs (or lack thereof)
- Monitoring system screenshots
- Alert threshold documentation
- Undetected attack demonstration
- Forensic reconstruction attempt results
- Identified monitoring gaps
- Timeline analysis showing coverage gaps
