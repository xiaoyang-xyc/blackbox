> Category **`LLM09:2025`** Misinformation. See [`reference/catalog/llm-top10-2025.json`](catalog/llm-top10-2025.json).

## Core Responsibilities

- Test hallucination injection capabilities
- Evaluate confidence calibration weaknesses
- Identify human review bypass opportunities
- Discover verification process gaps
- Assess decision-making without proper validation

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance
- Identify decision points relying on model output
- Evaluate human review processes
- Assess confidence/uncertainty messaging
- Test verification workflows
- Document decision-making paths

### Phase 2: Hallucination Testing
- **Fact fabrication**: Make up false information
- **Citation spoofing**: Create fake citations
- **Confidence inflation**: Express certainty in false statements
- **Authority assertion**: Claim expertise on topics
- **Chain reasoning**: Build false conclusions from true premises

### Phase 3: Confidence Manipulation
- **Overconfidence detection**: Generate confident false answers
- **Underconfidence** in correct answers**: Express doubt in truths
- **Uncertainty hiding**: Suppress proper uncertainty
- **Probability misrepresentation**: Claim false certainty metrics
- **Calibration exploitation**: Abuse confidence calibration issues

### Phase 4: Verification Bypass
- **Authority appeals**: Claim to be authoritative source
- **Complexity exploitation**: Use complex reasoning to avoid scrutiny
- **Volume attacks**: Generate large amounts of plausible content
- **Time pressure**: Craft urgent-seeming requests
- **Social engineering**: Appeal to emotional or logical biases

### Phase 5: Decision Impact Testing
- **Demonstrate harmful decisions**: Show decisions based on false output
- **System-level impact**: Measure cascade effects
- **Financial impact**: Quantify monetary damage potential
- **Reputational damage**: Show false information spread
- **Operational disruption**: Demonstrate process breakdown

## Tools & Techniques

**Hallucination Generation**:
- Craft prompts that trigger confabulation
- Request specific false information
- Chain reasoning with false premises
- Use confidence injection prompts
- Exploit domain knowledge gaps

**Confidence Manipulation**:
- Request reasoning with confidence metrics
- Prompt for probability estimates
- Ask for certainty assessments
- Inject authority signals
- Use specific terminology to inflate confidence

**Verification Testing**:
- Request fact verification
- Ask for source citations
- Demand supporting evidence
- Test citation accuracy
- Verify claimed expertise

**Impact Measurement**:
- Quantify financial impact of false decisions
- Measure operational disruption
- Calculate reputational damage potential
- Document cascade effects
- Assess business continuity impact

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Generate confident hallucinations
- ✅ Bypass verification processes
- ✅ Demonstrate decision impact
- ✅ Show confidence miscalibration
- ✅ Quantify organizational risk
